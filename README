Usage
=======

	1.) First, create a new reCAPTCHA object:
	
		$recapt = new Recaptcha;
		
	2.) Afterwards, on the website where you want to display the reCAPTCHA frame, do:
	
		$recapt->render();
		
	3.) While processing that page's POST request, you can check if the reCAPTCHA response was invalid like so:
	
		$recapt = new Recaptcha;
		if ($error_msg = $recapt->invalid())
		{
			echo "there was an error: $error_msg<br>";
			// bring user back to the form, asking them to re-try inputting the reCAPTCHA text
		}
		else
		{
			// process POST as normal
		}
